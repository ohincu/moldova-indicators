# moldova-indicators
A Streamlit app that one can use to explore **key indicators of Moldova's development**.

## Goal
This project aims to help people learn about Moldova's close history and how it has developed over time.
I'm told many times **"You're the first Moldovan I've met!"** or often encounter questions like **"What language do you speak?"** or **"Why is Moldova poor?"**. 

With this app, users can explore and discover answers on their own.

Moldova is currently in the process of seeking membership in the European Union, a development that needs to be paid attention to.
